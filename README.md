# MessengerBackend

### This is a chat app backend developed by me as a side project with initial goal of learning ASP.NET

It is mainly WIP by now, but I am aiming to create a client and make this into a working prototype

The initial idea was a Telegram clone, but I am not planning to add advanced features such as videos, voice messages, bots, etc. yet

The architecture of the project is monolith, but its modular nature allows to split it into microservices.

Main goals of the project include:
- Learning C# and ASP.NET
- Using as many good practices as possible
- Making it highly scalable
- Easy deploy using techniques such as Docker
